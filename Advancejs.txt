
1.Template literals (Template strings) :-
-ES6 version 2015
- It provides an easy way to create multiline strings
-The ${} syntax allows us to put an expression in it and 
it will produce the value.
-Template Literals use back-ticks symbol (``) 


2. Arrow Function (Fat arrow Function) :-
-Arrow functions are introduced in ES6
-It's provide a more accurate way to write the functions in JavaScript.
-They allow us to write smaller function syntax. 
-Fat arrow notation/lambda notation: It is the notation for the arrow (=>).

3.Rest Parameter :-
- used in function with multiple parameter
- The rest parameter is introduced in ECMAScript 2015 or ES6
- which improves the ability to handle parameters.
- The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array
- Arguments is an Array -like object accessible inside functions that contains the 
values of the arguments passed to that function.
- The rest parameter allows us to represent an indefinite 
number of arguments as an array
- The rest parameter is show with three dots (...)

4.Spread Operator
-introduced a new operator referred to as a spread operator, 
which consists of three dots (...)
-Spread operator syntax is similar to the rest parameter,
-The spread operator is commonly used to make copies of JS objects

5. Array destructuring :- 
-  Array destructuring introduced in ES6.
- Destructuring means to break down a complex structure into simpler parts.
- It can be used for assignments and declaration of a variable.
- Destructuring is an efficient way to extract multiple values from 
  data that is stored in arrays .
- When destructuring an array, we use their positions (or index) in an assignment.

6.Object destructuring :-
- It is similar to array destructuring.
- When destructuring the objects, we use keys as the name of the variable.
- The variable name must match the property (or keys) name of the object.
- If it does not match, then it receives an undefined value.
